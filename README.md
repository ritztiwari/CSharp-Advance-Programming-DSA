## 📂 Branch Structure

### 🔹 `sorting` branch
This branch focuses on Sorting Algorithms in C#, covering both basic and advanced sorting techniques.
The problems are designed using real-world scenarios (students, employees, products, salaries) to help understand algorithm logic, time complexity, and data organization in a practical way.
All sorting programs are implemented from scratch to strengthen DSA fundamentals.

---

### 📝 Practice Problems

- **Bubble Sort – Sort Student Marks**  
  Implement Bubble Sort to arrange student marks in ascending order by repeatedly comparing and swapping adjacent elements.

- **Insertion Sort – Sort Employee IDs**  
  Use Insertion Sort to sort employee IDs by inserting elements into their correct position in a growing sorted portion of the array.

- **Merge Sort – Sort Book Prices**  
  Apply Merge Sort to sort book prices by dividing the array recursively and merging sorted subarrays.

- **Quick Sort – Sort Product Prices**  
  Implement Quick Sort using a pivot-based partitioning approach to efficiently sort product prices.

- **Selection Sort – Sort Exam Scores**  
  Use Selection Sort to repeatedly select the minimum element and place it in its correct position.

- **Heap Sort – Sort Job Applicants by Salary**  
  Build a Max Heap and repeatedly extract the maximum element to sort salary demands in ascending order.

- **Counting Sort – Sort Student Ages**  
  Implement Counting Sort to sort student ages efficiently when the input range is small and known.

### 🔹 `searching` branch
This branch focuses on **searching algorithms, efficient string manipulation, and file handling concepts** in C#.  
It is designed to strengthen **DSA fundamentals**, **performance-aware coding**, and **real-world I/O handling** using built-in .NET utilities.

The branch is organized into **three focused folders**:
- `Searching`
- `StringBuilder`
- `File-Handling`

  Reverse a given string using `StringBuilder` instead of built-in reverse methods.

- **Remove Duplicates from a String Using StringBuilder**  
  Remove duplicate characters while maintaining the original order.

- **Concatenate Strings Efficiently Using StringBuilder**  
  Concatenate an array of strings using `StringBuilder` for better performance.

- **Compare StringBuilder Performance**  
  Compare the performance of `StringBuilder` with normal string concatenation for repeated operations.

---

###  `File-Handling`
Covers **file input/output operations** using `StreamReader` and basic stream concepts.

### 📝 Practice Problems

- **Read a File Line by Line Using StreamReader**  
  Read and display each line from a text file.

- **Count the Occurrence of a Word in a File**  
  Read a file and count how many times a specific word appears.

- **Convert Byte Stream to Character Stream**  
  Read binary data from a file and display it as characters.

- **Read User Input and Write to File**  
  Take input from the console and store it in a file using stream operations.

---

### `Searching`
Focuses on **Linear Search and Binary Search** techniques, including real-world and advanced problems.

#### 📝 Linear Search Problems

- **Search for the First Negative Number**  
  Find the first negative number in an integer array using Linear Search.

- **Search for a Specific Word in Sentences**  
  Find the first sentence containing a given word using Linear Search.

---

#### 📝 Binary Search Problems

- **Find the Rotation Point in a Rotated Sorted Array**  
  Identify the index of the smallest element using Binary Search.

- **Find the Peak Element in an Array**  
  Find an element greater than its neighbors using Binary Search.

- **Search for a Target Value in a 2D Sorted Matrix**  
  Perform Binary Search on a row-wise sorted 2D matrix.

- **Find First and Last Occurrence of an Element**  
  Locate the first and last index of a target element in a sorted array.

---

#### 🚀 Challenge Problem (Linear + Binary Search)

- **First Missing Positive & Target Search**
  - Use **Linear Search** to find the first missing positive integer.
  - Sort the array and apply **Binary Search** to find the index of a target element.
  - Return `-1` if the target is not found.
